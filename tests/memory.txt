CODE COVERAGE IMPROVEMENT MISSION
=====================================

OBJECTIVE: Get all files in src/server, src/services, src/transport, and src/types to 80%+ code coverage.
CONSTRAINT: Only modify tests/ folder by creating NEW test files. Do NOT modify existing tests or source code.

CURRENT STATUS (from latest coverage report):
==============================================

FILES BELOW 80% COVERAGE (PRIORITY TARGETS):
1. src/services/a2a/state/update: 55.55% 
   - artifact.ts: 33.33% (uncovered lines: 9-32,41,48)
   - update.ts: 61.76% (uncovered lines: many including 77-78,88-89,97-98,108-109,117-118,122-123,127-128,133,157)

2. src/transport/trpc/a2a: 77.77%
   - trpc.ts: 77.77% (uncovered lines: 29,35)

3. src/transport/trpc/a2a/routes/tasks: 52.17%
   - route.ts: 52.17% (uncovered lines: 23-42,55,67,76)

4. src/types/utils: 0%
   - transform.ts: 0% (uncovered lines: 45-81)

FILES AT/ABOVE 80% (ALREADY MEETING TARGET):
- src/server/express: 92.3% ‚úÖ
- src/services/a2a: 84.61% ‚úÖ
- src/services/a2a/factory: 82% ‚úÖ
- src/services/a2a/managers: 87.5% ‚úÖ
- src/services/a2a/methods: 89.87% ‚úÖ
- src/services/a2a/state: 80% ‚úÖ
- src/services/core/execution: 100% ‚úÖ
- src/services/core/managers: 90.14% ‚úÖ
- src/transport/rpc: 89.47% ‚úÖ
- src/transport/streaming: 86.84% ‚úÖ
- src/transport/trpc/a2a/factory: 100% ‚úÖ
- src/transport/trpc/a2a/routes: 100% ‚úÖ
- src/transport/trpc/a2a/routes/message: 81.81% ‚úÖ
- src/types/interfaces/services: 100% ‚úÖ
- src/types/schemas/a2a: 93.84% ‚úÖ

NEXT STEPS:
1. Examine source files for the 4 priority targets to understand what needs testing
2. Create new test files in tests/ folder to cover uncovered code paths
3. Re-run coverage to verify improvements
4. If all targets reach 80%, increase threshold to 90% and continue

WORK LOG:
- Initial analysis completed
- Created comprehensive test files for all 4 priority targets
- MAJOR SUCCESS: 3 out of 4 targets now have 100% coverage! üéâ

RESULTS AFTER FIRST TEST RUN:
‚úÖ src/services/a2a/state/update: 100% coverage (was 55.55%) - ACHIEVED TARGET!
‚úÖ src/transport/trpc/a2a: 100% coverage (was 77.77%) - ACHIEVED TARGET!  
‚úÖ src/types/utils: 100% coverage (was 0%) - ACHIEVED TARGET!
‚ùå src/transport/trpc/a2a/routes/tasks: 52.17% (was 52.17%) - STILL NEEDS WORK

CURRENT STATUS: 
- 3/4 targets are now above 80% (actually at 100%!)
- Only 1 target still needs improvement
- Need to fix failing tests in tasks route test file
- Overall coverage improved from 82.34% to 88.79%
