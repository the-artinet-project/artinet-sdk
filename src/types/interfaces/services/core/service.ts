 * Core service interface defining the contract for all service implementations.
 *
 * Services are responsible for orchestrating command execution through execution
 * engines, managing the execution lifecycle, and providing a consistent interface
 * for starting and stopping operations. This interface serves as the foundation
 * for all service types in the core framework.
 *
 * The service acts as a coordinator between execution engines and the broader
 * system, handling concerns like resource management, execution tracking, and
 * graceful shutdown while delegating the actual command processing to engines.

   * Executes a command using the provided execution engine and context.
   *
   * This is the primary method for processing commands. The service receives
   * an execution engine (which defines how to process the command) and a
   * context (which contains the command, state, and execution environment).
   *
   * The service is responsible for:
   * - Coordinating the execution process
   * - Managing resources during execution
   * - Handling the stream of updates from the engine
   * - Ensuring proper cleanup on completion or failure
   *
   * @param engine - The execution engine that will process the command
   * @param context - The execution context containing command and environment
   * @returns Promise that resolves when execution is complete
   *
   * @throws Should handle and wrap any execution errors appropriately
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * // Basic execution
   * await service.execute(myEngine, executionContext);
   *
   * // With error handling
   * try {
   *   await service.execute(myEngine, executionContext);
   * } catch (error) {
   *   console.error('Execution failed:', error);
   *   await handleExecutionError(error, executionContext);
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * // Service implementation with update handling
   * async execute(engine, context) {
   *   const updates: TUpdate[] = [];
   *
   *   try {
   *     for await (const update of engine(context)) {
   *       updates.push(update);
   *       await this.notifySubscribers(update);
   *
   *       if (context.isCancelled()) {
   *         console.log('Execution cancelled');
   *         break;
   *       }
   *     }
   *   } catch (error) {
   *     await this.handleExecutionError(error, context);
   *     throw error;
   *   }
   *
   *   console.log(`Execution completed with ${updates.length} updates`);
   * }
   * ```

  /**
   * Stops the service and performs cleanup operations.
   *
   * This method is called to gracefully shut down the service, ensuring that
   * all active executions are properly terminated and resources are cleaned up.
   * Implementation should handle stopping active executions, releasing resources,
   * and preparing for service shutdown.
   *
   * The stop method should be idempotent - calling it multiple times should
   * not cause errors or unexpected behavior.
   *
   * @returns Promise that resolves when the service has been stopped and cleaned up
